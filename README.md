## 👋 Greetings, fellow code adventurers!

I'm J. Shamsul Bahri, but you might know me better as 'jibone' across the digital realm.

👴 I've witnessed the evolution from chunky 5.25" floppies to cloud storage, survived the dial-up modem cacophony, and marvelled at the rise (and fall) of Flash websites. However, a ‘tech fossil’, I am not!

🚀 Despite my "vintage" status in tech years, I always love working and experimenting with modern cutting-edge dev tools and tech stack. 

🔮 Current obsessions:
- Diving deep into the Web3 rabbit hole
- Exploring the mind-bending possibilities of Generative AI

🤝 I'm on the lookout for kindred spirits in these realms. I’m always looking for exciting projects to collaborate on. 

🌐 Find me in the wild:
- Tweeting away @jibone
- Sharing thoughts at jshamsul.com
